```bash
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss postcss
# 💡 make sure to install postcss-loader as well and 
```
> For custom alias to work for tailwind it must be configured inside the webpack.renderer.config make sure to add path.resolve for the same and postcss-loader in rules

> 💀 always do --legacy-peer-deps when adding shadcn components

> Start electron app
```bash
# navigate to mcp-client
npm run start
```
> Starts only mcp-server 
```bash
# navigate to mcp-server
uv run mcp_server.py
```

> Start gateway & mcp-server as subprocess on tool invocations
```bash
# navigate to gateway/
uv run main.py
```

> recap basic flow scaffolded
```bash
Electron app logs in, gets JWT.

Electron app calls /tools/add/invoke with:

json
{ "arguments": { "a": 2, "b": 3 } }

FastAPI receives the request, spawns MCP server as subprocess, calls add(a=2, b=3).

MCP server returns 5.

FastAPI returns {"result": 5} to Electron app.

Electron app displays the result.
